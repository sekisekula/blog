I am a graduate of the 1st High School Bolesław Krzywoustego in Nakło nad Notecią on a mathematics and IT profile, I also completed the first degree of Electrical Engineering at the Poznan University of Technology. Currently I study second degree related to computer science and econometrics at Poznan University of Economics and Business.

At this moment, I am focused on data analysis (Python + SQL), I would like to become a specialist in machine learning and big data in future.
